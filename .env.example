# Safety Control: Label Purchase Prevention
# ==================================================
# DANGER: ENABLE_SHIPPO_LABELS allows real label purchases with real money!

# Keep this FALSE to fetch rates only (safe mode):
# - Creates shipments and customs declarations
# - Generates commercial invoices and CN22/CN23 forms
# - NO label purchase, NO charges
#
# Set to TRUE only when you need to actually purchase a shipping label:
# - Requires second confirmation ("Type BOOK to confirm")
# - Creates real label and tracking number
# - CHARGES your Shippo account
# - Cannot be easily undone
#
# Default: false (recommended for testing)
